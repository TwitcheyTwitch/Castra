						Founding Story
						<p>Castra Corporation was established in 2950 by a visionary group of business owners seeking to reshape the landscape of industry and manufacturing.</p>
						Frustrated with the monopolistic grip of mega-corporations in systems like Stanton and Terra, they aspired to create an organization that championed self-reliance and cooperative success.
						<br>Initially operating out of the bustling industrial environment of ArcCorp (Stanton III), the organization aimed to create a collaborative yet self-reliant manufacturing hub that focused on profitability, innovation, and mutual cooperation. 
						<br>The founders have their sights set on the Castra system as their future home base due to its strategic location and rich, yet underutilized, resources. 
						<br>The name "Castra," derived from the ancient term for a military camp or fortress, symbolizes their commitment to building a stronghold of industry and opportunity for those seeking independence and growth through mutual prosperity.
						<p>The early days saw Castra Corporation setting up advanced manufacturing facilities and resource extraction operations. Their foundational motto, "Forge Together, Prosper Together," encapsulated their mission to build a profitable environment that nurtured individual growth while advancing collective goals.</p>

						Castra is an organization that focuses on salvage, mining, and logistics. Our members tend to be a bit more mature than the average player. 
						We're a relaxed organization with a laid-back mentality. Most of us have been playing this game for a while. Castra's members have been there, done that, and probably wrote a guide about it.
						<br>We have ticket systems, guides, player support, and events.
						<br>We're looking to expand Castra, and we need you. If you would like to become a member, click the following link to join us at Castra Corporation.
